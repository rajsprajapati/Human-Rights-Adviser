4.  **Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW):**
    *   **Article 1:** Defines discrimination against women as any distinction, exclusion, or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment, or exercise by women, irrespective of their marital status, on a basis of equality of men and women, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural, civil, or any other field.

3.  **Legal Action:**
    *   Consult with a legal professional specializing in employment law and human rights.
    *   File a lawsuit in national courts, citing relevant anti-discrimination laws and international human rights standards.
