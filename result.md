This scenario appears to be a violation of the principle of equality and non-discrimination, specifically gender discrimination in employment, which is prohibited under international human rights law.

Relevant legal provisions:

*   **Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR):**

    *   Article 2: Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.
    *   Article 23(2): Everyone, without any discrimination, has the right to equal pay for equal work. (While this refers to pay, the principle extends to equal opportunities for career advancement.)
*   **International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR):**

    *   Article 3: The States Parties to the present Covenant undertake to ensure the equal right of men and women to the enjoyment of all economic, social and cultural rights set forth in the present Covenant.
*   **Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW):**

    *   Article 1: Defines discrimination against women.
    *   Article 11: Addresses discrimination in employment, including the right to equal opportunities and treatment. This specifically includes:

        *   "(a) The right to work as an inalienable right of all human beings;
        *   (b) The right to the same employment opportunities, including the application of the same criteria for selection in matters of employment".

**Steps to take if this occurs:**

1.  **Gather Evidence:** Collect any documentation that supports your claim of higher qualifications and consistent high performance, as well as evidence that the male colleague was less qualified or experienced.
2.  **Internal Grievance Procedures:** If your workplace has internal grievance procedures, follow them to formally lodge a complaint.
3.  **National Human Rights Institutions:** Contact your national human rights institution or equality body. They can investigate the complaint and potentially mediate a resolution.
4.  **Legal Counsel:** Consult with an attorney specializing in employment or discrimination law to understand your legal options.
5.  **File a Complaint:** File a formal complaint with the relevant labor authorities or anti-discrimination agencies in your country.
6.  **International Mechanisms (if national remedies are exhausted):** If national remedies are exhausted without resolution, consider submitting a communication to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, provided your country is a party to the Optional Protocol to CEDAW.
